# Bootstrap Demo



### Description  
This application is designed to demonstrate the simplicity of Bootstrap in place of extensive CSS for web applications. Utilizing Bootstrap as an alternative to completely coding your own CSS can be a very easy and useful option. The majority of the effects on this page were done using Boostrap. Here, the jumbotron, image carousel, cards, list boxes, row and columns, responsiveness, and some text coloring were all made possible with just a fraction of the options available through Bootstrap's CSS and documentation.
